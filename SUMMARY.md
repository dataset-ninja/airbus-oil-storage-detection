**Sample Oil Storage Tank Detection Dataset from Airbus SPOT Satellite Imagery** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the aviation industry.

The dataset consists of 103 images with 13592 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*oil-storage-tank*).

Images in the Airbus Oil Storage Detection dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 5 (5% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *extras* (5 images) and *images* (98 images). The dataset was released in 2021 by the [AIRBUSGEO, France](http://www.intelligence-airbusds.com/).

This dataset is a demonstration version of larger and more advanced deep learning datasets created from Airbus satellite imagery. It is provided for demonstration purpose only.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
