The **Airbus Oil Storage Detection Sample Dataset** is a subset derived from larger deep learning datasets developed using Airbus satellite imagery. The authors of the dataset present this version for illustrative purposes. The dataset aims to showcase the capabilities of Deep Learning in automatically detecting characteristics of Aboveground Petroleum, Oil and Lubricant (POL) storage areas, including the number, size, and type of POL storage on various sites. This automated detection contributes to monitoring the condition of aboveground fuel storage tanks, facilitating tasks such as spill prevention, overfill prevention, and corrosion monitoring.

Airbus Defense and Space Intelligence, a key player in commercial satellite imaging, operates the largest commercial satellite constellation, integrating optical imagery from Pléiades, SPOT, Vision-1, and DMC, along with radar imagery from TerraSAR-X, TanDEM-X, and PAZ. The authors are continually enhancing their sensor capabilities through the upcoming Pléiades Neo constellation, which offers higher resolution, increased revisits, and expanded acquisition capabilities. The OneAtlas platform provides a user-friendly gateway to Airbus' premium satellite imagery, innovative geospatial analytics, and industry-specific insights.

The dataset comprises 98 image extracts from SPOT imagery, each at approximately 1.2 meters resolution. These images are stored as JPEG files with dimensions of 2560 x 2560 pixels, which corresponds to an area of 3 kilometers on the ground. The dataset encompasses locations worldwide, ensuring diversity.

Thorough annotations have been provided for all POL storage areas within the provided imagery. These annotations are represented as closed GeoJSON polygons.
